# DSA Practice with Striver's DSA Sheet

Welcome to my repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Striver's DSA Sheet. This repository contains my solutions to various DSA problems, implemented in C++.

## About

This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems listed in Striver's DSA Sheet. Striver's DSA Sheet is a comprehensive guide for mastering DSA, covering a wide range of topics and problem types. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-practice-striver-sheet.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd dsa-practice-striver-sheet
   ```



## Usage

To run a specific solution, navigate to the appropriate directory and compile the C++ file using your C++ compiler. For example, to compile and run `problem1.cpp` in the Arrays directory:

```sh
cd Arrays
g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1
./problem1
```
